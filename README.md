# Feed Reader Test

This small demo demonstrates testing using Jasmine under es5. We are testing a web-based application
that reads RSS feeds. The test file can be found under `feedreader.js`

# Running Tests

The tests can be executed by opening the file, `index.html`, in a browser. Wait for it to load it's 
contents and you should be able to see the test results on the bottom of the page. All of the tests
should pass
